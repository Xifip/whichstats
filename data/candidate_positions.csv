32,5,2,Candidate,3,We are totally opposed to the new water tax.

806,23,30,Candidate,1,Again it comes back to removing car parking spaces which are the lifeblood of our city traders. But pedestrianised quays would be a good place to start.,2014-05-14 21:31:58 UTC,2014-05-14 21:31:58 UTC

811,1,31,Candidate,1,We should utilise vacant housing to address the issue of social housing waiting lists in the city and county. We should also look at the improvement of existing social housing.

813,3,31,Candidate,1,I don't agree. It is anyone's right to build where they wish subject to planning permission. Much of our country is rural and contains one-off houses. This is part of our heritage and culture.,2014-05-14 21:31:58 UTC,2014-05-14 21:31:58 UTC

815,5,31,Candidate,3,I agree but with stipulations. It must be done by metre estimates so we only pay for what we use and those who can't pay are dealt with individually. I don't agree with a flat rate for everyone. Metres would lead to improved conservation of our water supply. Irish Water should be enshrined in law as a public company so our natural resources cannot be sold to private interests in the future. Also we have to get improved infrastructure for our water supply in return,2014-05-14 21:31:58 UTC,2014-05-14 21:31:58 UTC
816,6,31,Candidate,3,I agree property tax rates should be reduced because it is not a progressive tax in the sense that it does not take into account people in negative equity etc. Property does not equal wealth in all cases. If this means that we must cut spending in local services then we must review our spending to see where we can cut instead because spending on local services is the most important spending council has to make therefore we should find that money elsewhere,2014-05-14 21:31:58 UTC,2014-05-14 21:31:58 UTC
817,7,31,Candidate,3,Yes. It comes from the people locally therefore people should see a return.,2014-05-14 21:31:58 UTC,2014-05-14 21:31:58 UTC

1161,27,37,Candidate,3,I don't agree with fixed gender quotas. Parties should select the best candidates regardless of whether that are male or female. It is currently very difficult to encourage women and also young people to stand for election. The challenge is to made the role more attractive to them so that would like to stand rather than impose gender quotas ,2014-05-14 22:05:59 UTC,2014-05-14 22:05:59 UTC
